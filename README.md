### Markdown

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Markdown* is a _lightweight_ markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial description of Markdown[10] contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was addressed in 2014, when long-standing ~~Markdown~~ contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous specification and test suite for ***Markdown***.
